Save your <a href=\"/app/quotation\">Quotation</a> or <a href=\"/app/sales-order\">Sales Order</a>.\n2. If approval is required, change status to **Pending Approval** using the workflow action.\n3. Wait for a Sales Manager to approve.\n\n### Approve or return\n\nSales Managers can open the document and select **Approve** or **Return for Amendment**.\n\n## Update item discounts on existing items\n\nIf you change a rule and want to update item discounts:\n\n1. Open the rule.\n2. Click **Refresh/Update Items**.\n3. The system updates `max_discount` on items in the rule.\n\n## Imported items and landed cost\n\nIf an item is marked as **Imported**, the app can update its selling price using landed cost:\n\n- On <a href=\"/app/purchase-receipt\">Purchase Receipt</a> or <a href=\"/app/landed-cost-voucher\">Landed Cost Voucher</a> submit, the price is recalculated.\n- You can also click **Recalculate Selling Price** from the <a href=\"/app/item\">Item</a> form.\n\n## Common questions\n\n**Q: I do not see the guide in search.**\nA: Make sure you are logged in and have the **System User** role.\n\n**Q: An item should not be affected by a rule.**\nA: Remove it from the rule item list and save. It will stay excluded.\n\n**Q: Why is approval required?**\nA: The discount on at least one item is above the allowed limit.\n\n## Need help?\n\nContact your System Manager or Sales Manager for help with rules or approvals.\n",
